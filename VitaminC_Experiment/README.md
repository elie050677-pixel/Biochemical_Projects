# Vitamin C Experiment

**Aim:** To determine the amount of Vitamin C in various fruits using iodine titration.

**Materials:**
- Lemon juice  
- Mandarin orange juice
- Apple juice
- Iodine solution  
- Starch indicator  
- Dropper  

**Procedure:**
1. Add a few drops of starch indicator to the fruit juice.
2. Add iodine solution drop by drop until the color changes.
3. Record the number of drops used for each sample.

**Result:**
Lemon juice required fewer drops, meaning it contains more Vitamin C than mandarin orange juice.
Mandarin orange juice required fewer drops, meaning it contains more Vitamin C than apple juice.

**Its reason:**
Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) acts as electron donating (reducing) agent.
But iodine is an electron accepting (oxidizing) agent.

Iodine solution (I2) is usually present in water as triiodide ion (I3). It becomes so
